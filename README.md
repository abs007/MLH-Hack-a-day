## Inspiration 🌸✨👌
According to World Health Organization (WHO) , cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year. The problem is that there are a lot of people who are unaware of whether they are prone to having a heart attack. That was why we wanted to figure out a way to calculate it based on their age, sex, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level,  fasting blood sugar level, max heart rate, and whether they have exercise induced enigma.  We believe that by taking caution at an early age, there is a bigger possibility to prevent a heart attack to happen in the first place. 

## What it does 👨‍💻✔📜
There are three functions for the web app. First, and the main function is a system that predicts if a user is at a high chance of a heart attack by calculating using the data that was given by the user. If the user is indeed at a high risk, then we give the user the option to call from a list of numbers of hospitals, clinics, or doctors. 

The second function is a BMI calculator. The users have to input a weight (kg) and a height (cm) and it would display whether the user is underweight ,normal or overweight.  

The third function is an exercise section that shows examples of the kind of exercises that could be done by people who are prone to heart attacks or people who wants to exercise but don't know what to start with. 

## How we built it 🔧🔨🧰
We built the app using python, html, css, and javascript.

## Challenges we ran into 💀🏃‍♂️
The different time zones was definitely a challenge. But we were all understand and did our tasks while waiting for others to reply so no time was wasted. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🏅🏆
That we were able to make this together as a team. It is not always easy to make something together considering the time zones and not knowing each other prior to the event but we managed to overcome all of that and made a great web app!

## What we learned 🧠🙇‍♂️💻
We learned how to integrate different platforms like twilio, github, into making our work more efficient. Our team members varied from beginners to advanced so even the basic usage of html and css was something some on our teammates learned. 

## Time Management⏱⌛⏳🏃‍♂️
We had a tough time managing time this weekend with our participation in this Hackathon as we had to work on multiple things all together. Fortunately, we could do this by distributing out our work and focusing on multitasking. Extremely excited for all the learnings we had got through this hack.

## Hosting👩‍🏫👩‍💻
We learned how to claim a custom domain from GoDaddy and make the hosting work out.

## What's next for RestUp
We are planning to implement a google maps and a calling system. The google maps system will show the closest hospitals and clinics around the users and the calling system will show you a list of contacts ranging from the emergency hotline to a doctor near the user.
