Inspiration
According to World Health Organization (WHO) , cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year. The problem is that there are a lot of people who are unaware of whether they are prone to having a heart attack. That was why we wanted to figure out a way to calculate it based on their age, sex, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar level, max heart rate, and whether they have exercise induced enigma. We believe that by taking caution at an early age, there is a bigger possibility to prevent a heart attack to happen in the first place.

What it does
There are three functions for the web app. First, and the main function is a system that predicts if a user is at a high chance of a heart attack by calculating using the data that was given by the user. If the user is indeed at a high risk, then we give the user the option to call from a list of numbers of hospitals, clinics, or doctors.

The second function is a BMI calculator. The users have to input a weight (kg) and a height (cm) and it would display whether the user is underweight ,normal or overweight.

The third function is an exercise section that shows examples of the kind of exercises that could be done by people who are prone to heart attacks or people who wants to exercise but don't know what to start with.

How we built it
We built the app using python, html, css, and javascript.

Challenges we ran into
The different time zones was definitely a challenge. But we were all understand and did our tasks while waiting for others to reply so no time was wasted.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
That we were able to make this together as a team. It is not always easy to make something together considering the time zones and not knowing each other prior to the event but we managed to overcome all of that and made a great web app!

What we learned
We learned how to integrate different platforms like twilio, github, into making our work more efficient. Our team members varied from beginners to advanced so even the basic usage of html and css was something some on our teammates learned.
